      "heading1": "What is Bike Insurance and Why Is It Important?",
      "content1": "Bike insurance protects your two-wheeler from financial losses due to accidents, theft, fire, and third-party liabilities. In India, having third-party bike insurance is mandatory, making it a legal necessity. A comprehensive policy enhances this protection by covering damages to your own vehicle. With increasing road accidents and rising repair costs, having insurance provides financial relief, ensures peace of mind, and keeps you legally compliant.",
      "heading2": "Types of Bike Insurance Policies",
      "content2": "1. Third-Party Liability: Mandatory by law; covers legal liability for injuries or damages to third-party property or life.\n2. Comprehensive Policy: Includes both own damage and third-party liability; best for complete protection.\n3. Standalone Own Damage: Covers only your bike; useful if you already have third-party coverage.\n4. Zero Depreciation Plan: Full settlement without part depreciation; ideal for new or expensive bikes.",
      "heading3": "Coverage Inclusions and Exclusions",
      "content3": "Inclusions:\n- Damage due to accidents, fire, theft.\n- Natural disasters like earthquakes or floods.\n- Personal accident cover.\n- Third-party property and injury liability.\nExclusions:\n- Driving without a license.\n- Using the bike for commercial or racing purposes without proper cover.\n- Damage from drunk driving or negligence.\n- Normal wear and tear.",
      "heading4": "Key Factors That Influence Bike Insurance Premiums",
      "content4": "1. Bike's IDV and market value.\n2. Age and condition of the vehicle.\n3. Engine capacity.\n4. Previous claim history and NCB.\n5. Policy type and add-ons selected.\n6. Location and usage pattern.",
      "heading5": "How to File a Claim and Renew Bike Insurance",
      "content5": "Inform your insurer immediately after damage or theft. File an FIR if required. Submit documents like claim form, RC, DL, and FIR copy. Once verified, the insurer processes the claim either cashlessly or via reimbursement. Renew your policy before it expires to avoid NCB loss and to maintain continuous coverage."
